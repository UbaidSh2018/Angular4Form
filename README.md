# AngularForm

### Details: 
This is a simple form filling web app which has two pages. The application is extendable to multiple form pages.    
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2 and Angular4
    
##### Running the Project:
        
Run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

#### Journey through Task Completion: 
##### Biggest Challenge :  
Limited knowledge of programming with Angular(TypeScript). 
##### Approach: 
My approach to taking on this challenge started off with two questions:
    
1. Should I rush through the solution, deliver within the tight deadline and somehow make it work?
2. Should I take my time and use it as an opportunity to build a new skill while doing this task?
    
Initial thoughts: Go for number 2. But You need a job. There might be others submitting their codes before you. 
    
 ##### Hold On...

> What is my biggest motivation to apply for this job? - To learn new technologies!

> What is one of the essential skills they need? - Growth mindset â€“ willing to learn new programming languages, frameworks and architectures.
    
My decision - Go for Number 2: 
Take your time, build a new skill and prove your learning capabilities. 
                       
> Most good decisions start with "WHY?"
    
### Why?  
	
1. Show my learning capabilities and how I generally go about solving problems and taking on challenges.
2. Understand how the technology works.
3. Check out good coding practices in Angular.
4. Learn a design pattern and implement it.
5. Keep it simple but extendable.
    
### How? 
                  
1. Research Research Research: I went through multiple blogs and tutorials to create similar applications.
                            	It gave me a general idea on how to kickstart angular applications, where to look for dependencies, 
                            	code issues, snippets and inspirations.
2. Video tutorials: I went through a course on Angular4 I had bought last year on Udemy. It helped me in getting started with Typescript.
                               Being a Java programmer, I enjoyed TypeScript. In addition, a brush up on core Angular concepts of components and modules. 
    
3. GitHub Projects: I went through some GitHub projects to see how simple Angular applications work end to end. 
    
4. Design patterns: Having knowledge of OOP and SOLID in Java, I went on to use DRY and SRP in this project.
    
                               
### What? 
         
1.  The project has been organized according to features. Each has its own code file. 
    Using the patterns makes it easier to enhance, modify or debug quickly. 
    
2.  Each file handles a specific job assigned to it.   
    
3.	Naming of functions in the project has been done in a way to make them self-explanatory. 
    Thus, removing the need to explain in detail what's happening inside.
4.  The project implements a Routing Module for the sake of consistency.This adds the capability to find and expand routing     configuration.

### Technical Challenges:
1. Angular dependencies: Injecting dependencies and to make them work. It took a lot of time to implement as
    						I had to thoroughly go through the documentation and examples.
    
2. Package Versions: So important to check if the versions of node modules you've installed are compatible.
    					  	They may work like a charm with some versions of Angular and AngularCLI. 
    
3. AngularCLI: My computer had an older version of CLI(1.3.2) and Angular4. I realized in the later stage of this project that some features are limited with that version of CLI. 
I wanted to implement "ngx-toastr" module for a notification upon form submission 
but a lot of my time was lost in looking for solutions to bugs affecting other parts of application. At the end I decided to drop that extra feature.
                          
4. Webhooks: A new concept for me. I researched and came across a more user-friendly web-hook by Zapier. This helped me understand how they work. I tested my data submission on Zapier first and then moved to the one required to be used for this project.

### Improvements:
   
1. Production Ready Code: Configure the application to be run on a remote or local http-server. 

2. Build the application with a newer version of AngularCLI and leverage improvements in latest releases.

3. Use of Angular animations to enhance UX.

4. Further use of Angular Materials for an improved UI.
